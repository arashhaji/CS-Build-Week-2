'''
Understand: 
-instantiate our Class object
-add data to it
-pop the first element off the Queue and return it to a variable
-peek to get the first element without removal
-get a Boolean (True/False) if the Queue is empty or not

Planning:
-Instantiation is the Queueâ€™s storage object that will be used.
-push(val) is the way to add data to the Queue.
-pop() is the way to remove and return the front element in the Queue.
-peek() is the way to return the front element without removing it.
-empty() is the way to tell if a Queue is empty and contains any values.
